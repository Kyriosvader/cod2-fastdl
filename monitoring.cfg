// Name Checker
//***************************************************************************************************
// This is a small routine which is launched by the mod at the start of every game.
// It monitors player names for Unknown Soldiers if Unknown Soldier handling is enabled, and it
// monitors names for duplicates. If it finds two that match, it renames the second player to
// Unknown Soldier, which forces the player to change his name to something else (for duplicate
// names it will start the Unknown Soldier handling code regardless of the ex_uscheck setting)
