Known Issues
-----------
You can now use extented obituaries (set ex_obituary "8")  but its NOT advisable or recommended
If you enable anything above setting 4 then your console log WILL get ENORMOUS.
If you dont care, or dont use a console log...well then whats stopping ya......

Same goes for the extreme statsboard, it does show names now but will clutter your console log

Head and helmet popping are known to cause server crashes

Using the rain setting can cause serious lag on your server
